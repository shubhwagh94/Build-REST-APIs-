# Build-REST-APIs-
Given are the examples of REST APIs you have to build.   

Django Python Machine Test :-

Consider the following scenario where we have 3 entities in our system.
1. User
2. Client
3. Project

We have the number of users registered in our system.
You can use Djangoâ€™s default admin template to create/register users but not other entities or you can make REST APIs for users as well if you want.

You have to perform the following tasks :
1. Register a client
2. Fetch clients info
3. Edit/Delete client info
4. Add new projects for a client and assign users to those projects.
5. Retrieve assigned projects to logged-in users.


Things to consider :
1. The system has many users.
2. The system has many clients.
3. A client can have many projects
4. A single project can be assigned to many users.
